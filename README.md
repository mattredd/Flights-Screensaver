#  Flights Screensaver

**Flights Screensaver** is a demonstrator app where you can watch the planes fly by.

I have used the Canvas view from SwiftUI to animate the planes. I have also developed an algorithm that ensures that no two flights will "crash" into one another. This is done by calculating the potential rectangle that the two flights would intersect and then calculating the entry and exit timings for each of the flights and if the timings intesect then the planes would intersect.
